## Interpreting Charts

### Income vs Expenses (Line Chart)

**Green line above red line** = Saving money (good!) ‚úÖ
**Red line above green line** = Spending more than earning (warning!) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Lines converging** = Savings decreasing
**Lines diverging** = Savings increasing

**Example interpretation:**
```
Jan: Income $5k, Expenses $3k ‚Üí Saved $2k ‚úÖ
Feb: Income $5k, Expenses $4k ‚Üí Saved $1k (less)
Mar: Income $5k, Expenses $5.5k ‚Üí Lost $500 ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚Üí Trend is worsening, need to reduce spending!
```

### Category Breakdown (Pie Chart)

**Large slices** = Major spending areas (target for budgets)  
**Many small slices** = Diffused spending (hard to control)  
**One dominant slice** = Concentrated spending (easy to budget)

**Example interpretation:**
```
Groceries: 40% (large slice)
‚Üí Consider setting a grocery budget

10 slices each <5% (many small)
‚Üí Consider grouping into "Miscellaneous"
```

### Monthly Trends (Stacked Bar)

**Growing bars over time** = Spending increasing ‚ö†Ô∏è  
**Shrinking bars** = Spending decreasing ‚úÖ  
**Consistent bars** = Stable spending  
**Spikes** = Irregular expenses (investigate!)

**Example interpretation:**
```
Jul: $2,000
Aug: $2,100
Sep: $3,500 ‚Üê SPIKE!

‚Üí Check September for unusual purchases
```
