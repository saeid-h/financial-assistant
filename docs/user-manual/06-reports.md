## Interpreting Charts

### Income vs Expenses (Line Chart)

**Green line above red line** = Saving money (good!) ✅
**Red line above green line** = Spending more than earning (warning!) ⚠️
**Lines converging** = Savings decreasing
**Lines diverging** = Savings increasing

**Example interpretation:**
```
Jan: Income $5k, Expenses $3k → Saved $2k ✅
Feb: Income $5k, Expenses $4k → Saved $1k (less)
Mar: Income $5k, Expenses $5.5k → Lost $500 ⚠️

→ Trend is worsening, need to reduce spending!
```

### Category Breakdown (Pie Chart)

**Large slices** = Major spending areas (target for budgets)  
**Many small slices** = Diffused spending (hard to control)  
**One dominant slice** = Concentrated spending (easy to budget)

**Example interpretation:**
```
Groceries: 40% (large slice)
→ Consider setting a grocery budget

10 slices each <5% (many small)
→ Consider grouping into "Miscellaneous"
```

### Monthly Trends (Stacked Bar)

**Growing bars over time** = Spending increasing ⚠️  
**Shrinking bars** = Spending decreasing ✅  
**Consistent bars** = Stable spending  
**Spikes** = Irregular expenses (investigate!)

**Example interpretation:**
```
Jul: $2,000
Aug: $2,100
Sep: $3,500 ← SPIKE!

→ Check September for unusual purchases
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- **Review charts monthly** to catch trends early
- **Use date filters** to compare time periods
- **Export data** before making big changes
- **Focus on top categories** for budget planning
- **Look for spikes** in stacked bar chart (investigate)

### ❌ DON'T

- Don't analyze without categorizing first (charts won't be useful)
- Don't compare different date ranges without adjusting for length
- Don't ignore trends (they show problems early!)

## Understanding Chart Data

### What's Included

**Income:**
- Salary, wages, bonuses
- Refunds, cashback
- Gifts received
- Interest earned

**Expenses:**
- Groceries, dining, shopping
- Bills, utilities, insurance
- Transportation, gas
- Entertainment, subscriptions

**EXCLUDED from charts:**
- **Transfers** (between accounts)
- **Uncategorized transactions** (in some charts)

### Why Transfers Are Excluded

Transfers don't change your net worth:
- Paying credit card from checking = $0 net change
- Moving savings to checking = $0 net change
- Internal movements ≠ income or expenses

**Charts show TRUE income/expenses** without transfer noise.
