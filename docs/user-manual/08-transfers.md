## Overview

Transfer transactions represent money moving **between your own accounts**. They are **NEUTRAL** - they don't change your net worth.

**Examples:**
- Paying credit card from checking
- Moving money from savings to checking
- Transferring between accounts
- Internal account adjustments

---

## Why Transfers Matter

### The Problem

**Without transfer categorization:**
```
Income:   $5,000
Expenses: $3,500 (includes $500 credit card payment)
Net:      +$1,500

BUT WRONG! The $500 payment isn't an expense!
```

**With transfer categorization:**
```
Income:    $5,000
Expenses:  $3,000
Transfers: $500 (neutral - between your accounts)
Net Flow:  +$2,000 ← TRUE wealth change!
```

### The Impact

**On Reports:**
- Charts exclude transfers
- Show TRUE income vs TRUE expenses
- No double-counting of money movements

**On Budgets:**
- Transfers don't count against spending budgets
- Only actual expenses are tracked

**On Account Balances:**
- Both accounts update correctly
- Net worth stays same (as it should)

## Identifying Transfers

### Visual Indicator

Transfer transactions appear in **PURPLE** (not red or green):

```
Transaction List:
Date       Description              Amount      Color
10/15/25   PAYCHECK                +$3,500.00  GREEN
10/14/25   COSTCO WHSE            -$156.78    RED
10/10/25   CITI AUTOPAY           +$500.00    PURPLE ← Transfer!
10/08/25   SHELL GAS              -$45.23     RED
```

### Category Type

All transfers are categorized under:
```
🔄 Transfers & Neutral (Level 1)
  └─ Account Transfer (Level 2)
```

---

## Common Transfer Patterns

### 1. Credit Card Payments

**From your checking account:**
```
Description: "CITI AUTOPAY" or "CREDIT CRD PAYMENT"
Amount: +$500.00 (in credit card statement)
OR
Amount: -$500.00 (in checking statement)

Category: Account Transfer
Color: PURPLE
```

**Why it's neutral:**
- You're moving YOUR money
- Checking decreases $500
- Credit debt decreases $500
- Net worth: $0 change

### 2. Savings Transfers

**Moving to savings:**
```
Checking: "Transfer to Savings" -$1,000
Savings: "Transfer from Checking" +$1,000

Category: Account Transfer
Color: PURPLE
```

**Why it's neutral:**
- Total cash still same
- Just in different account
- Net worth: $0 change

### 3. Account Adjustments

**Bank corrections, interest:**
```
Description: "Interest Earned" +$2.50

Category: Might be Income (not transfer)
```

**Be careful**: Interest IS income, not a transfer!

## Auto-Categorization of Transfers

The system has **9 built-in rules** for transfers:

| Pattern | Example Transaction | Category |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| CREDIT CRD.*AUTOPAY | CREDIT CRD AUTOPAY | Account Transfer |
| AUTOPAY.*CREDIT | AUTOPAY CREDIT CARD | Account Transfer |
| Online Transfer | Online Transfer to Savings | Account Transfer |
| TRANSFER | Account Transfer | Account Transfer |
| Payment.*Credit Card | Payment to Credit Card | Account Transfer |
| CITI AUTOPAY | CITI AUTOPAY | Account Transfer |
| CHASE CREDIT CRD | CHASE CREDIT CRD AUTOPAY | Account Transfer |
| APPLECARD.*PAYMENT | APPLECARD PAYMENT | Account Transfer |
| Account Transfer | Account Transfer | Account Transfer |

**Result**: Most credit card payments auto-categorize to transfers!

## How Transfer Accounting Works

### Bank Account (Asset) Perspective

**Example**: Paying $500 credit card bill from checking

```
Checking Account (Asset):
Date       Description       Amount      Effect
10/10/25   AUTOPAY          -$500.00    Money OUT
                                         ↓
                                    Goes to pay credit card
```

### Credit Card (Liability) Perspective

```
Credit Card (Liability):
Date       Description       Amount      Effect
10/10/25   AUTOPAY          +$500.00    Debt DOWN
                                         ↓
                                    Reduces what you owe
```

### Net Worth Calculation

```
Before Payment:
Checking: $2,000 (asset)
Credit:   -$1,000 (liability)
Net Worth: $1,000

After $500 Payment:
Checking: $1,500 (asset)
Credit:   -$500 (liability)
Net Worth: $1,000 (UNCHANGED!)

→ Transfer is NEUTRAL to net worth
```

## Viewing Transfer Summary

On the **Transactions page**, you'll see a dedicated card:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💹 Transfers                        │
│ $6,500.00                           │
│ Between accounts (neutral)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**This shows:**
- Total absolute value of all transfers
- Sum of money moved between accounts
- NOT included in Net Cash Flow

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Credit Card Autopay

**Your situation:**
- Credit card has $800 balance
- Autopay from checking for $800

**What you'll see:**
```
Checking Account:
"CITI AUTOPAY" -$800.00 PURPLE

Credit Card:
"AUTOPAY PAYMENT" +$800.00 PURPLE

Statistics:
Transfers: $800.00
Income: (unchanged)
Expenses: (unchanged)
Net Flow: (unchanged)
```

**Correct!** Moving money between accounts.

### Scenario 2: Building Emergency Fund

**Your situation:**
- Transfer $500/month from checking to savings

**What you'll see:**
```
Checking: "Transfer to Savings" -$500.00 PURPLE
Savings: "Transfer from Checking" +$500.00 PURPLE

Net Worth: UNCHANGED
(Money just moved location)
```

**BUT** if you categorize the savings transfer as "Savings Account" under Transfers, reports will track your savings behavior!

### Scenario 3: Mistaken Transfer

**Your situation:**
- "ATM WITHDRAWAL" categorized as Transfer
- But it's actually cash withdrawal (expense!)

**What to do:**
1. Go to Transactions
2. Find the ATM transaction
3. Click category button
4. Recategorize to: Variable Expenses → Cash Withdrawal
5. Click "✓ Assign Category"

**Now it shows as expense (RED) instead of transfer (PURPLE)**

## Transfer vs. Expense: When to Use Which

### Use "Account Transfer" When:

✅ Paying credit card from checking  
✅ Moving money between your own accounts  
✅ Bank account adjustments  
✅ Internal transfers  

### Use "Expense" When:

❌ ATM cash withdrawal (you spent it!)  
❌ Wire transfer to someone else (payment!)  
❌ Check written to another person  
❌ Venmo/Zelle to friends (expense or gift)  

### Gray Area: Savings

**Option A: Transfer** (Neutral)
- Moving to savings = just relocating money
- Doesn't count as "expense"
- Net worth unchanged

**Option B: Savings Category** (Expense type)
- "Paying yourself first"
- Counts as allocation of income
- Track savings rate

**Recommendation**: Use Transfer category, but you can create a "Savings Contribution" under Transfers for tracking.

## Statistics Explained

### On Transactions Page

```
💰 Income & Deposits: $5,000.00
   ↑ All money coming IN

💸 Expenses & Withdrawals: $3,000.00
   ↑ All money going OUT

💹 Transfers: $500.00
   ↑ Money moving between accounts (NEUTRAL)

📊 Net Cash Flow: +$2,000.00
   ↑ Income - Expenses (excludes transfers!)
```

**Formula:**
```
Net Cash Flow = Income - Expenses

Transfers are NOT included because they don't change net worth!
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- **Categorize credit card payments as transfers** (not expenses)
- **Check transfer amounts match** between accounts
- **Use auto-categorize** to catch transfers automatically
- **Review transfers monthly** to ensure accuracy

### ❌ DON'T

- Don't categorize ATM withdrawals as transfers (they're expenses!)
- Don't count transfers in your expense budget
- Don't double-count (if both sides imported, one is enough)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: My credit card payment shows as expense  
**Solution**: Recategorize to "Account Transfer" or run "Auto-Cat Uncategorized"

**Issue**: Transfer showing as income/expense in reports  
**Solution**: Make sure it's categorized under "Transfers & Neutral" type

**Issue**: I see the same transfer twice  
**Solution**: If you imported both checking and credit card statements, the same payment appears in both - this is normal and accurate (shows both sides)

**Issue**: Net Cash Flow doesn't match my calculations  
**Solution**: Transfers are excluded from Net Cash Flow - only income and expenses count
