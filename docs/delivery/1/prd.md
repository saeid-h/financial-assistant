## Overview

Establish the foundational project infrastructure including version control, Python environment, Flask application framework, database schema, and testing framework. This PBI creates the technical foundation upon which all other features will be built.

## Problem Statement

Before implementing any features, we need a properly configured development environment with:
- Version control for code management
- Python virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Database schema for data persistence
- Web framework for UI and API
- Testing framework for quality assurance
- Project structure following best practices

## User Stories

As a developer, I want to:
1. Have a properly initialized git repository with clear commit conventions
2. Work in an isolated Python virtual environment
3. Have a running Flask application as the web framework
4. Have a SQLite database with defined schema
5. Have a testing framework ready for TDD
6. Follow a clear project structure for maintainability

## Technical Approach

### 1. Version Control Setup
- Initialize git repository
- Create comprehensive .gitignore (Python, IDE, database, logs)
- Create git-rules.md document for commit conventions
- Configure remote repository (URL to be provided by user)

### 2. Python Environment
- Create virtual environment using venv
- Install core dependencies:
  - Flask (web framework)
  - pandas (CSV parsing and data analysis)
  - pytest and pytest-cov (testing)
- Create requirements.txt for dependency management

### 3. Project Directory Structure

### 4. Database Schema Design

**Accounts Table**
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- name (account name)
- type (checking, savings, credit)
- institution (bank name)
- created_at
- updated_at

**Transactions Table**
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- account_id (FOREIGN KEY)
- date
- description
- amount (positive for income, negative for expense)
- category_id (FOREIGN KEY, nullable)
- notes
- tags (JSON or separate table)
- created_at
- updated_at

**Categories Table**
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- name
- parent_id (FOREIGN KEY, nullable - for hierarchy)
- level (1, 2, or 3)
- type (income or expense)
- created_at

**Categorization_Rules Table**
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- pattern (text pattern to match)
- category_id (FOREIGN KEY)
- priority (for rule ordering)
- match_count (number of times applied)
- created_at
- updated_at

### 5. Flask Application Structure
- Create basic Flask app with:
  - Application factory pattern
  - Blueprint structure for routes
  - Database initialization
  - Static file serving
  - Template rendering
  - Basic home page

### 6. Testing Framework
- Setup pytest with conftest.py
- Create test database fixture
- Create sample data fixtures
- Basic smoke tests for Flask app

## UX/UI Considerations

- Not applicable for this infrastructure PBI
- Basic Flask app will serve a simple "Welcome" page to verify setup

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
2. ✅ git-rules.md document created with commit conventions
3. ✅ Python virtual environment created and activated
4. ✅ requirements.txt created with core dependencies
5. ✅ All dependencies installed without errors
6. ✅ Project directory structure created as specified
7. ✅ SQLite database created with all tables and relationships
8. ✅ Flask application runs without errors on localhost:5001
9. ✅ Home page accessible and displays welcome message
10. ✅ pytest runs successfully with 13 tests passing
11. ✅ Remote git repository configured (https://github.com/saeid-h/financial-assistant)
12. ✅ README.md created with project overview and setup instructions

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: None (foundational PBI)

**Downstream**: All other PBIs depend on this infrastructure

**External Dependencies**:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- Modern web browser
- Remote git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
