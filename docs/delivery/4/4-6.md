# Task 4-6: Create Learning System

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement learning system that generates categorization rules from user's manual categorizations.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-10-19 22:20:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task created | Saeed |
| 2025-10-19 22:20:00 | Approved | Proposed | Agreed | Key to system improvement | Saeed |
| 2025-10-19 22:22:00 | Completed | Agreed | Done | Learning API implemented | Saeed |

## Requirements

1. learn_from_categorization() method in engine
2. Extract meaningful patterns from descriptions
3. Create or update rules automatically
4. Higher priority for user-created rules
5. API endpoint to trigger learning

## Implementation

**CategorizationEngine:**
- learn_from_categorization(): Learns from user input
- _extract_pattern(): Extracts meaningful keywords
- Removes noise words, numbers, special chars
- Uses first 1-2 significant words
- Priority 100 for user rules (higher than system's 95)

**Categories API:**
- PUT /categories/api/categorize/:id with "learn": true
- Automatically creates rules when user categorizes
- Updates existing rules if pattern exists

## Verification

- [x] Learning method implemented
- [x] Pattern extraction working
- [x] Rules created from user input
- [x] User rules have higher priority
- [x] API endpoint available

## Files Modified

**Modified:**
- `src/services/categorization_engine.py` - Learning methods
- `src/routes/categories.py` - Learning API endpoint

## Notes

Learning system is implemented but not yet exposed in UI.
Future enhancement: "Apply to similar transactions" checkbox.
