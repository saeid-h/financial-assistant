[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the pattern-based categorization engine that automatically assigns categories to transactions based on description matching.

| 2025-10-19 22:00:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task created | Saeed |
| 2025-10-19 22:10:00 | Approved | Proposed | Agreed | Core of auto-categorization | Saeed |
| 2025-10-19 22:15:00 | Completed | Agreed | Done | Engine fully implemented | Saeed |

## Requirements

1. Pattern matching with confidence scoring
2. Support for OR patterns (e.g., "COSTCO|WALMART")
3. Confidence thresholds (High 90%, Medium 70%, Low 50%)
4. Priority-based rule ordering
5. Learning system for user corrections
6. Pattern extraction from descriptions

## Implementation

Created `src/services/categorization_engine.py`:
- categorize_transaction(): Match single transaction
- categorize_transactions_bulk(): Batch processing
- create_rule(): Add new rules
- learn_from_categorization(): Generate rules from user input
- _calculate_match_confidence(): Scoring algorithm
- _extract_pattern(): Smart pattern extraction

## Verification

- [x] Engine created
- [x] Pattern matching works
- [x] Confidence scoring accurate
- [x] Handles OR patterns
- [x] Learning system implemented
- [x] Integrated with import workflow

## Files Modified

**New:**
- `src/services/categorization_engine.py`
