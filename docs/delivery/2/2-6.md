# Task 2-6: Implement Transaction Storage Service

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

**Note: This task was consolidated into Task 2-5 (Create Import Upload UI).**

## Implementation Details

Transaction storage was implemented in Task 2-5 using:
- `src/models/transaction.py` - Transaction model with `create()` method
- `src/routes/import_routes.py` - Import route that stores transactions after validation
- Transaction storage includes all required fields: account_id, date, description, amount

## Verification

- [x] Transactions can be stored in database
- [x] All required fields are saved
- [x] Foreign key relationships maintained (account_id)
- [x] Timestamps auto-generated
- [x] Integration tests passing

## Files

See Task 2-5 for complete implementation details.
