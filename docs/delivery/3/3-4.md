## Test Results

**Unit Tests**: 96 passed ✅
**Integration Tests**: 29 passed ✅
**Total**: 125 tests passed ✅

### Key Tests Verified:
- ✅ Account CRUD operations
- ✅ Transaction import (including 800+ transactions)
- ✅ Session cookie bug fix
- ✅ Transaction model database path fix
- ✅ CSV parsing (100+ format variations)
- ✅ Transaction validation
- ✅ Duplicate detection
- ✅ Account details statistics
- ✅ Currency formatting

## Bugs Fixed During Testing

1. **Transaction Model Database Path**:
   - Issue: Static methods used hardcoded `DB_PATH`, broke tests
   - Fix: Added `_get_db_path()` to use Flask config during tests
   - Files: `src/models/transaction.py`

2. **Import Confirm Validator API**:
   - Issue: Called `validate()` instead of `validate_transaction()`
   - Fix: Updated to correct method name
   - Files: `src/routes/import_routes.py`

3. **ValidationResult Property Access**:
   - Issue: Called `is_valid()` method instead of property
   - Fix: Changed to `is_valid` property access
   - Files: `src/routes/import_routes.py`

## Verification

- [x] All 125 tests passing
- [x] No test failures
- [x] No warnings blocking functionality
- [x] Import workflow handles large files
- [x] Account details page working
- [x] Statistics calculated correctly
- [x] Currency formatting applied

## Files Modified

**Modified**:
- `src/models/transaction.py` - Fixed database path resolution for tests
- `src/routes/import_routes.py` - Fixed validator API calls
- `tests/integration/test_import.py` - Added debug output

## Notes

All tests passing successfully. The session cookie bug fix and Transaction model database path fix were critical for the import workflow to work correctly with large CSV files and in test environments.
