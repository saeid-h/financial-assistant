| 2025-10-19 21:37:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task created | Saeed |
| 2025-10-19 21:37:00 | Approved | Proposed | Agreed | Part of account details feature | Saeed |
| 2025-10-19 21:37:00 | Completed | Agreed | Done | Implemented alongside task 3-2 | Saeed |

## Requirements

1. Add action buttons to account cards
2. "View Transactions" button links to `/accounts/<id>/details`
3. "Edit" button opens edit modal
4. Remove whole-card click behavior (too ambiguous)
5. Maintain responsive design

## Implementation Plan

**Changes to `accounts.html`**:
- Add `.account-card-actions` CSS class
- Add `.btn-small` CSS class for compact buttons
- Update `displayAccounts()` JavaScript to include action buttons
- Remove `onclick` from card wrapper

## Test Plan

**Manual Tests**:
- Click "View Transactions" on account card
- Click "Edit" on account card
- Verify responsive layout on mobile
- Test with multiple accounts

## Verification

- [x] Action buttons added to cards
- [x] "View Transactions" links to details page
- [x] "Edit" button opens modal
- [x] Card hover effects maintained
- [x] Responsive design working
- [x] Manual tests passing

## Files Modified

**Modified**:
- `src/templates/accounts.html` - Added card actions section with buttons

## Notes

This task was completed alongside Task 3-2 as they were closely related. The account cards now have explicit action buttons instead of relying on whole-card click behavior, improving usability and accessibility.
